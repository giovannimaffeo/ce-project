1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results for algorithm 'evolve_both' and test 'hiperparams_fatorial_test':

Combination 1: p = 0.3771 → Normal
Combination 2: p = 0.7805 → Normal

Result: All combinations are parametric.

2. Pairwise Independent t-tests for combinations of algorithm 'evolve_both' and test 'hiperparams_fatorial_test':

→ Results without Bonferroni correction:
Combination 1 vs Combination 2: Not significant (raw p = 0.0558, t = -2.24)

→ Results with Bonferroni correction:
Combination 1 vs Combination 2: Not significant (adjusted p = 0.0558, t = -2.24)

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (without correction):
1. Combination 1 — 0 wins
2. Combination 2 — 0 wins

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (with Bonferroni correction):
1. Combination 1 — 0 wins
2. Combination 2 — 0 wins
