1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results:

Random Search (Combination 4): p = 0.3838 → Normal
EA Search (Combination 4): p = 0.8452 → Normal

Result: All combinations are parametric.

2. Pairwise Independent t-tests for combinations of algorithm 'stats_random_search_vs_ea_search_controller_scenario_test' and test 'random_search_vs_ea_search_test':

→ Results without Bonferroni correction:
Combination 2 beats Combination 1 (raw p = 0.0000, t = -14.68)

→ Results with Bonferroni correction:
Combination 2 beats Combination 1 (adjusted p = 0.0000, t = -14.68)

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (without correction):
1. Combination 2 — 1 wins
2. Combination 1 — 0 wins

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (with Bonferroni correction):
1. Combination 2 — 1 wins
2. Combination 1 — 0 wins
