1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results:

Random Search (Combination 6): p = 0.0367 → Not normal
EA Search (Combination 6): p = 0.3228 → Normal

Result: At least one combination is not parametric.

2. Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests for combination 1 (Random Search) and combination 2 (EA Search):

→ Results without Bonferroni correction:
Combination 2 beats Combination 1 (raw p = 0.0079)

→ Results with Bonferroni correction:
Combination 2 beats Combination 1 (adjusted p = 0.0079)

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (without correction):
1. Combination 2 — 1 wins
2. Combination 1 — 0 wins

→ Ranking based on number of pairwise wins (with Bonferroni correction):
1. Combination 2 — 1 wins
2. Combination 1 — 0 wins
