1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results for algorithm 'random_search' and test 'controller_scenario_test':

Combination 1: p = 0.1689 → Normal
Combination 2: p = 0.8568 → Normal
Combination 3: p = 0.0258 → Not normal
Combination 4: p = 0.3838 → Normal
Combination 5: p = 0.1782 → Normal
Combination 6: p = 0.0367 → Not normal

Result: At least one combination is not parametric.

2. Due to the normality test indicating non-parametric data, performing Kruskal-Wallis test for differences between parameter combinations of algorithm 'random_search' and test 'controller_scenario_test':
Result: p = 0.0015
Conclusion: At least one combination differs significantly from the others.
