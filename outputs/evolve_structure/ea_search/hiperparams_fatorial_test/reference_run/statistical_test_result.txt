1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results for algorithm 'ea_search' and test 'hiperparams_fatorial_test':

Combination 1: p = 0.4147 → Normal
Combination 2: p = 0.9638 → Normal
Combination 3: p = 0.4188 → Normal
Combination 4: p = 0.1998 → Normal
Combination 5: p = 0.5071 → Normal
Combination 6: p = 0.0093 → Not normal
Combination 7: p = 0.7649 → Normal
Combination 8: p = 0.0080 → Not normal
Combination 9: p = 0.1127 → Normal
Combination 10: p = 0.2163 → Normal
Combination 11: p = 0.8088 → Normal
Combination 12: p = 0.7938 → Normal
Combination 13: p = 0.5862 → Normal
Combination 14: p = 0.3278 → Normal
Combination 15: p = 0.6271 → Normal
Combination 16: p = 0.4648 → Normal

Result: At least one combination is not parametric.

2. Due to the normality test indicating non-parametric data, performing Kruskal-Wallis test for differences between parameter combinations of algorithm 'ea_search' and test 'hiperparams_fatorial_test':
Result: p = 0.5877
Conclusion: No significant difference between combinations.
