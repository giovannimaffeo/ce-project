1. Shapiro-Wilk normality test results for algorithm 'ea_search' and test 'controller_scenario_test':

Combination 1: p = 0.2011 → Normal
Combination 2: p = 0.2254 → Normal
Combination 3: p = 0.9611 → Normal
Combination 4: p = 0.8452 → Normal
Combination 5: p = 0.0080 → Not normal
Combination 6: p = 0.3228 → Normal

Result: At least one combination is not parametric.

2. Due to the normality test indicating non-parametric data, performing Kruskal-Wallis test for differences between parameter combinations of algorithm 'ea_search' and test 'controller_scenario_test':
Result: p = 0.0001
Conclusion: At least one combination differs significantly from the others.

3. Pairwise Mann-Whitney U tests for combinations of algorithm 'ea_search' and test 'controller_scenario_test':
